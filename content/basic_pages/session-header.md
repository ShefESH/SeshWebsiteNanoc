While we strongly encourage participants in the society to [buy a membership](/join), it's important that interested individuals have the opportunity to trial a session before joining. To that end, you can attend your first session free as a non-member, but please bring your U-card so we can record that you have attended.

Our regular sessions are hosted in person and streamed on Blackboard Collaborate, every Monday at 18:00 - 19:30 (ish). Members will be given access to our Blackboard Collaborate Organisation, from which they can view all sessions and recordings.

Please bring the following equipment to all sessions unless specifically said otherwise:

- a laptop (any operating system is fine, and you can use [the university's laptop loan facility](https://libraryhelp.shef.ac.uk/faq/191357). If the need for a laptop is a barrier to you attending a session, please [speak to someone on the committee](/contact).)
- your U-card - required for non-members attending a trial session, and also required to access some of the rooms we use or if you want to use the laptop loan facility
- your [ShefESH membership card](/wiki/About_the_Society/Membership_Cards), if you have one
