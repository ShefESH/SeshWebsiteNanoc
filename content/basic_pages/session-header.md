While we strongly encourage participants in the society to [buy a membership](/join), it's important that interested individuals have the opportunity to trial a session before joining. To that end, we offer one free session a year to non-members.

Our regular sessions are hosted in person and streamed on Blackboard Collaborate, every Monday at 18:00 - 19:30 (ish). Members will be given access to our Blackboard Collaborate Organisation, from which they can view all sessions and recordings.

Please bring a laptop to all sessions unless said otherwise. If you are not able to, please [speak to someone on the committee](/contact).
