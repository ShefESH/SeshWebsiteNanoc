        <p class="highlight-alternative">We deliver regular sessions covering a variety of cybersecurity topics</p>
        <p>We'll teach you all the theory, including <span class="highlight">web application attacks</span> 
            and <span class="highlight">buffer overflows</span>.</p>
        <p>And we'll go from the theory to applying it to <span class="highlight">ethical hacking!</span>.</p>
        <p>To teach you this we do <span class="highlight-alternative-2">live demos, CTF challenges, theory lectures, worksheets and more!</span></p>
        <p>We formed in 2018</p>
        <p>We're also always trying to expand our links with industry, and have some fun guest talks planned this year!</p>
