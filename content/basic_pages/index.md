### We deliver regular sessions covering a variety of cybersecurity topics
We'll teach you all the theory, including <span class="highlight">web application attacks</span> and <span class="highlight">buffer overflows</span>.

And we'll go from the theory to applying it to <span class="highlight">ethical hacking!</span>

To teach you this we do <span class="highlight">live demos, CTF challenges, theory lectures, worksheets and more!</span>

We formed in 2018

We're also always trying to expand our links with industry, and have some fun guest talks planned this year!
