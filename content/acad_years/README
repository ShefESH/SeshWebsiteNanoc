This directory will contain a subdirectory for each academic year the society is active.

Each year folder should be in the format YYYY_YY (i.e 2025_26)
Inside this folder you need: people/ and sessions/

Within people/ put a folder with the name of the person, and within the folder create a markdown (.md) file with the name profile,
i.e joe/profile.md
<br/>
Also put a photo, preferably in the format (name).jpg - it must be a jpg/jpeg format

Within the markdown file, copy and paste:
```
---
id:
role:
priority: 
name: 
bio:
image:
---
```
<br/>
The id should be lowercase first name of the person.
Priority should be determined based on role:
- 0: President
- 1: Core Committee (Inclusions, Treasury, Secretary)
- 2: Other Roles (Tech, Competitions, etc)
- 3: General Members
<br/>
image should be the name of the image file uploaded earlier AND should include the extension (i.e joe.jpeg)
