Penetration testing involves simulating an attack on a system and is a key part of cyber security. This talk from a former Sheffield student about the experiences and perspective of a pentester/red teamer will be useful both for people looking to go into security as well as people involved in creating and developing systems software as it will need to be secure.
Our AGM will also be held at this meeting.
