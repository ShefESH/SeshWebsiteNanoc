# Creating a Broadcom account

To download and run VMware you need a Broadcom account. Creating one is fairly straightforward:

- visit the [https://profile.broadcom.com/web/registration](account registration page), and enter your email address
- you will immediately be sent a verification code by email that you will need to enter on the next page
- finally you will be asked to provide your name and country, and agree to the terms and conditions.

All being well, you should see a page like this:

![Broadcom "Registration Successful" page](../vmw_successful-registration.png)

Once you've reached this point, you have an account (you can ignore everything about "building your profile" and just click "I'll do it later") and can move on to the next section.

# Downloading VMware

Use the appropriate download page, which depends on your operating system:

- Linux and Windows users: [VMware Workstation Pro](https://support.broadcom.com/group/ecx/productdownloads?subfamily=VMware+Workstation+Pro)
- MacOS users: [VMware Fusion](https://support.broadcom.com/group/ecx/productdownloads?subfamily=VMware+Fusion)

You will probably be prompted to log in - use the account details you created previously.

Select the lastest version which is marked as "for personal use". At the time of writing, this was version 17 for Workstation and version 13 for Fusion:

Click on the latest release number that appears:

Click the download button that appears on the next page. If there is a "Agree to Terms and Conditions" box, you will have to tick that before the download button will work:

Click "yes" when asked whether to proceed with "additional verification". You will then be asked to enter an address, which is apparently required for Broadcom to comply with US software export regulations. If you'd prefer not to use your own address, you may use the address of the Society:

> Western Bank
> Sheffield
> South Yorkshire
> S10 2TG

You will also be asked to agree that you will not re-export the software or use it "for nuclear. missile, chemical biological weaponry. or other weapons of mass destruction".

Once you've done that, click "Submit" - you'll end up back on the download page, and you'll have to click the download icon _again_ to actually download the file.
