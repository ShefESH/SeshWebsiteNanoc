This page provides a step-by-step guide to setting up a virtual machine (VM) running Kali Linux, which will be useful for many ShefESH sessions as well as some of our [Fundamental Skills guides](/wiki/Fundamental_Skills). It's written assuming you have never carried out this sort of task before, so it will be quite specific in exactly what software you should use and how you should set it up. If you're more confident, though, you don't have to follow it to the letter - in particular, you may prefer to use a different hypervisor (see below).
