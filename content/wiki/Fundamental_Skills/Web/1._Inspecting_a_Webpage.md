This page was a guide to inspecting webpages using the tools available in your browser. It made heavy use of the old (pre-2024) ShefESH website as an example, so we will be writing a new version for the current website.

In the meantime, you can [view the previous guide (PDF)](/acad_years/2022_23/sessions/3_Intro_to_Web_Hacking/web-1---inspecting-a-webpage.pdf), though bear in mind the examples may no longer be as useful.
