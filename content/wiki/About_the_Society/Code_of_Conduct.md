The skills taught by the Sheffield Ethical Student Hackers' Society (hereafter referred to as _the Society_) allow identification and exploitation of security vulnerabilities in systems. Ethical hacking is a fun and rewarding activity, and the primary aim of the Society is to offer a safe, legal environment for members to learn and practice it, but **your** actions can have devastating effects if you use those skills irresponsibly. 

Because of this, everyone involved with the Society - including Society members and committee, guest participants in Society activities and users of the Society's online resources - **must** follow this code of conduct at all times. 

**Please familiarise yourself with the code of conduct and make sure you understand it fully.** If there is anything you do not understand, or you are unsure whether something you intend to do is allowed, you must ask a member of Society committee before proceeding.

1. You agree to adhere to all relevant local, national and international laws governing computer misuse and hacking, most notably:
    - the [Computer Misuse Act 1990](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/18)
    - the [Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23)
    - the [Serious Crime Act 2015](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/9)

2. You understand that the Society, Sheffield Students’ Union and the University of Sheffield **will not** be held responsible for any actions undertaken with the tools or techniques explained during the Society’s activities.

3. The Society will offer an isolated, designated platform for hacking activities to be undertaken upon, on a best-effort basis. You agree and understand that it is solely your responsibility to ensure that any hacking activities you undertake occur only on the Society’s platform, on your own equipment or on third-party systems with **explicit written permission**.

4. You understand that you **must not** activate or use any hacking tools/techniques while connected to the Internet through the University’s network (i.e. eduroam) unless otherwise explicitly specified. 

5. When using your own equipment at an event operated by the Society, you agree to take sole responsibility for ensuring that it is correctly configured. In particular, you must ensure that networking settings do not compromise the availability of the Society’s infrastructure or expose yourself or others to danger.

6. Where the society uses or recommends 3rd-party services, it will provide information regarding the specific rules and regulations governing their use. You agree to familiarise yourself with such rules and regulations, and ensure you comply with them at all times while using these services

7. If you are in **any doubt** about the technical, legal or ethical implications of your actions, you agree to stop those actions **immediately** and inform a Society committee member.

Non-compliance with the code of conduct is a serious breach of trust and will **always** lead to disciplinary action, which may include suspension or expulsion from the Society and referral to the disciplinary procedures of Sheffield Students' Union and the University of Sheffield. In extreme cases, the Society will alert the relevant legal authorities.
