At your first session after you join the society, you will be issued with a membership card.  Please bring it with you for all subsequent sessions in the academic year.

If you forget your membership card for a session, you can still attend, but please bring a screenshot of your membership purchase at the SU. This will allow you to participate in the session and we can also replace your card if you have lost it permanently.

Membership cards are valid for one academic year. If you have purchased a 2-year membership, you can collect a new membership card at the start of the second year.
